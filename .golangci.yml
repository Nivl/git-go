  # we remove a few annoying gosec rules:
  # G104 is used for errcheck. It gets triggered on places that don't
  #      don't need it like (*bytes.Buffer).Write(), and we already have
  #      errcheck.
  # G304 is used to warn about file inclusion via variable. It basically
  #      blocks every `os.File(variable)`
